# Exercise 1: Creating a new GitHub repository


---
## Step 1: Getting started with GitHub and GitHub Desktop.

For this exercise, you will need a GitHub account. If you do not already have a GitHub account, please create one at [github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

We will also be using the GitHub Desktop application to demonstrate tasks. If you are new to GitHub, we recommend downloading and installing GitHub Desktop ([desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)) to follow along with the exercise instructions. 

---

## Step 2: Create a new repository.

Open GitHub Desktop, and go to the menu bar.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_01.png")
```


---

## Step 2: Create a new repository.

.pull-left[
Make sure you check the option to "Initialize this repository with a README". It is good practice to also add a gitignore file and a [license](https://choosealicense.com/) when you create a repository.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_02.png")
```
]

---
## Step 2: Create a new repository.

.pull-left-35[
You've created your repository on your local computer! Now, we want to publish the repository to GitHub.
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_03.png")
```

]

---
## Step 2: Create a new repository.

.pull-left-35[
You can uncheck the option to keep the repository private, if you want. OK, now it's ready to publish!
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_05.png")
```

]

---
## Step 2: Create a new repository.

.pull-left-35[
You've just create a new GitHub repository! __Congratulations!__

The rightmost tab has now changed to "Fetch origin". This tells you that your local repository is linked with the remote repository. Fetching the origin means you can _fetch_ (or _pull_) any changes on the remote repository, to update your local version.
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_06.png")
```

]

---
## Step 3: Change a document in your repository.

Now, let's change a file in our repository to see how GitHub works. Navigate to the folder you created as a new repository.

You can see that we have a gitignore file, as well as a license, and a README.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_07.png")
```

---
## Step 3: Change a document in your repository.

.pull-left-35[
Open the README in your favourite text editor. It is pretty empty - let's add something to it!
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_08.png")
```

]

---
## Step 3: Change a document in your repository.

.pull-left-35[
Open the README in your favourite text editor. It is pretty empty - let's add something to it!

OK, now __save__ the README file!
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_09.png")
```

]


---
## Step 3: Change a document in your repository.

.pull-left-35[
Go back to GitHub Desktop, to take a look at the change you've made in your files.

The highlighted green line shows that you have made an _addition_ to your file. 

This seems like a good place to make a commit!
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_10.png")
```

]

---
## Step 4: Commit and push this change to the web.

.pull-left-35[
Whenever you commit a change, you should add an informative message that describes the changes you've made. 

Here, we've made a pretty small change, so we can keep the message simple: "add some information".

Looks good! Let's click on __"Commit to main"__.
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_11.png")
```

]


---
## Step 4: Commit and push this change to the web.

.pull-left-35[
Now that we've made a commit, we need to push it to the remote. 

The rightmost tab shows that we can __Push__ 1 commit to the origin. That's what we want to do!
]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_12.png")
```

]

---
## Step 4: Commit and push this change to the web.

.pull-left-35[
If we navigate to the repository on github.com, we can see that the changes have been pushed to the remote.

]

.pull-right-65[

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "imgs/exercise01/ex1_13.png")
```

]
