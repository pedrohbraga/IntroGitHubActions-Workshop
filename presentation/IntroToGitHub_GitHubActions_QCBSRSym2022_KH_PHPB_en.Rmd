### GitHub & GitHub Actions are powerful tools for collaboration and open science

GitHub is increasingly used by researchers as a tool to work on their research in an __open__ and __reproducible__ way. Like our science, GitHub is especially powerful in __collaborative__ contexts. 

Today's workshop will discuss:

- How GitHub can help you do open, transparent, and collaborative science (_briefly_)

- How to use GitHub Actions to automate some common tasks in research, to keep your work up to date as you (and your collaborators) contribute to a project
  - **Code checking** on a different system than your local computer
  - **Performing** analyses and making visualizations  
  - **Rendering** and __deploying__ documents (presentations, webpages, Shiny apps) 
  
- How to __troubleshoot__ GitHub Actions when they don't work!

???

> _.small[Today, we will spend less time on _how to use GitHub_ - but don't worry! There are many resources available freely online to learn about GitHub (e.g. [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jennifer Bryan). ]_

### A brief introduction to GitHub 

**GitHub** allows you to manage documents and code in a __transparent, collaborative, and traceable way__.

.pull-left[
#### Version Control

GitHub keeps tracks of the _changes_ you make to your documents, and allows you to flip back to previous versions if you need to.

#### Transparent & Open

You can work privately, but GitHub also allows you to open your repository (i.e. project folder) to the public. You can choose a [license](https://choosealicense.com/) to control how your documents can be used by others. 
]

.pull-right[
#### Collaborative Workflow

Features like branching, issues, and pull requests help to coordinate collaborations dynamically, so you can keep track of all contributions to a project in one place.

#### Automating Tasks 🌟

GitHub Actions automate tasks like code checks, document rendering, deploying webpages, and more. This becomes powerful quickly, particularly when you need to continuously integrate contributions to your project. 
]

???

Actions can also protect your project, by ensuring that changes are only integrated if they pass certain checks.

## Q: Do you use GitHub for your research?

GitHub is becoming popular among researchers in biodiversity but it is still not widely adopted.

Have you encountered obstacles when learning how to use it? <br>
What are some reasons you would recommend it to others? <br>
Why do you think it is not widely adopted in biodiversity research?

## How GitHub works (in a nutshell)

__Git__ is an open source version-control system.

__GitHub__ is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

You can think of Git as a tool that allows you to _track the changes_ you make in your documents on your local computer, and apply them to the same documents that are hosted in a _repository_ on GitHub. 

Git also allows you to apply any changes that have been made on the GitHub repository (also called the _remote_) to the documents on your local computer.

---
class: center, middle

## The GitHub workflow: A basic example

---
### Step 1: Setting up a repository.

Often, you have some project folder on your local computer that you want to __publish__ as a repository on GitHub.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/2.png")
```


???

Note: A repository can be set up in several ways. You can also _clone_ a repository from GitHub to your local computer. 

repositories, files, directories, commits, pushes, pull requests, commit history, authors, cloning, and checkout. 
From GitHub Docs:
git: an open source, distributed version-control system
GitHub: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories
commit: a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA
branch: a lightweight movable pointer to a commit
clone: a local version of a repository, including all commits and branches
remote: a common repository on GitHub that all team member use to exchange their changes
fork: a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user
pull request: a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews, comments, integrated
tests, and more

---
### Step 1: Setting up a repository.

You can also _clone_ or _fork_ a repository from GitHub to your local computer. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/1.png")
```



---
### Step 2: Pull the _remote_ repository to your local computer.

Once a repository is set up, you usually want to get to work. __Pulling__ ensures that the documents on your local computer match up with the versions on the _remote_ repository on GitHub.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/3.png")
```

---
### Step 3: Make changes to the files on your local computer.

Now that everything matches up, you can start making some changes in your files. When you save changes to a file, Git tracks the _addition_ and _deletion_ of any characters. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/4.png")
```

---
### Step 4: __Commit__ your changes.

When you are ready to confirm this new version of your document, you stage and _commit_ your changes. This essentially makes a _snapshot_ of the repository, from which you can flip back and forth.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/5.png")
```

---
### Step 5: __Push__ your committed changes to the _remote_ repository.

You then __push__ the changes that you committed on your local computer to the _remote_ repository. 
<br><br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/6.png")
```

???

Note: You can flip back and forth between these _commits_ to work on different versions of your documents. That means you don't have to keep saving files with ever-increasing file names (e.g. Final_draft_May2022_comments_June2022_finaledits.pdf).

---
## A __collaborative__ GitHub workflow

GitHub becomes even more powerful when you are working collaboratively in a repository. 

When working on a project with a collaborator, they can start a __new branch__ from the main repository. 

Branches are essentially a _working copy_ of the repository, where you can commit changes _without affecting the main repository_. 

Branches can be __merged __ into the main repository through a __pull request__, which can be reviewed and approved by the owner of the repository (or other authorized contributors). 

This is very helpful to manage contributions from different collaborators who are working on the same files at the same time!

Let's walk through an example of this workflow.

---
## Step 1: Make a new branch

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/7.png")
```

---
## Step 2: Commit changes in the files

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/9.png")
```

---
## Step 3: Make a pull request

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/10.png")
```

---
## Step 4: Merge the branch into the remote repository

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/github_workflow/11.png")
```

---
## Exercise: Set up a GitHub repository

Let's make a repository that we will use to play with GitHub Actions later in this workshop!

### Common research workflows in ecology and evolution

.pull-left[
Research in ecology and evolution often involves the processing and merging of data from multiple sources.

We commonly combine, clean multiple data files (usually, types of spreadsheets) for subsequent analysis (in the form of code).

This process is rarely done just once in a project's lifetime: we add and remove information, and adjust our analysis. 

.onfire[This increases output generation and errors.]

### Adopting automated research workflows in ecology and evolution

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which small adjustments to the underlying code in an application are tested every time a team member makes changes.

CI decreases integration problems [3], ensures
rapid feedback [4], increases software quality [2], and improves developer productivity [5].

# GitHub Actions: Workflows


---

## Workflows are written in __YAML__.

.pull-left[
To make a workflow, you write a __YAML__ file that is stored in your repository, in a directory called `.github/workflows`.

YAML is a human-readable programming language. It is important to remember that _indentation matters_ in YAML!

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.cap="An example of a YAML file containing a workflow."}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/yaml_example.png")
```
]

---

## __Events__ trigger the workflow.

.pull-left[

Workflows run when they are __triggered__ by an event. 

To trigger a workflow, you can:

- __Manually__ start the workflow
- Define triggers `on` __events__ in your repository (e.g. _pushes_ to your `main` repository branch, a _pull request_, a new _issue_, etc.)
- Set a __schedule__ to regularly trigger the workflow.

```

]
]

---

## The workflow runs __jobs__.

.pull-left[
A workflow is an automated process that runs one or more __jobs__. 

Jobs include one or more _steps_ to achieve some objective (checking code, producing a document, etc.).

You can run a single job, but often you will need to configure your workflow to run several jobs. 

Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.

### Our `deploy-presentation-en` workflow runs __two jobs__.

![](imgs/action_example_jobs.png)

---

## Jobs are run by __runners__.

.pull-left[
A _runner_ is a server that runs your workflows in a __*fresh* virtual machine__ each time it is triggered. 

Each runner runs one job at a time.

GitHub offers __Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS__ runners. This means you can test your scripts and documents on different systems, to ensure your files work the same for everyone else!

# How to use GitHub Actions

---

## __GitHub Actions__ perform tasks 

.pull-left-35[

A __GitHub Action__ is an application that performs a task. 

This task is usually something that is __repeated__ often, such as setting up an environment to build your documents, installing R, and building documents like presentations or websites.

Actions help to _simplify_ your workflow.

.shout[You can look for Actions on [__GitHub Marketplace__](https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=&type=actions&verification=).]

![](imgs/github_marketplace.png)

???

You can also [create](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions?learn=create_actions&learnProduct=actions) your own Action, but you can usually find Actions that do what you need them to do!

## __GitHub Actions__: checkout

.pull-left[For example, the first step in our workflow is to __checkout the repository__. To do this, we `use` the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

This action takes care of checking out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so that your workflow can access it to do the next tasks.

## __GitHub Actions__: Set up R

.pull-left[

We then need to __set up__ R on our Ubuntu runner (remember - it's fresh! new!). To do this, we `use` the [setup-r](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r) action. 

See [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) for more Actions for R.

## __GitHub Actions__: you can use R!

.pull-left[

GitHub Actions are particularly useful for _complex_ steps in your job.

For simpler tasks, you can run __R code__ directly in your workflow using this syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Rscript -e 'code here'
```
