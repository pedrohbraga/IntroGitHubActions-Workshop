# What is GitHub and why should I use it?

### A brief introduction to GitHub 

**GitHub** allows you to manage documents and code in a __transparent, collaborative, and traceable way__.

.pull-left[
#### Version Control

GitHub keeps tracks of _changes_, allowing you to flip between versions.

#### Transparent &amp; Open

A public repository shows the complete history of contributions to your project, and opens access to your code or documents for use by others (tip: choose a [license](https://choosealicense.com/)). 
]

.pull-right[
#### Collaborative Workflow

Track and integrate contributions from collaborators dynamically, in one place.

#### Automating Tasks 🌟

GitHub Actions automate tasks in a continuously integrated workflow.
]

???

Actions can also protect your project, by ensuring that changes are only integrated if they pass certain checks.

## Q: How can GitHub make research more open and collaborative?

GitHub is becoming popular among researchers in biodiversity but it is still not widely adopted.

Why do you think it is not widely adopted in biodiversity research? &lt;br&gt;
What are some obstacles to using GitHub? &lt;br&gt;
What are some reasons you want to learn it, or would recommend it to others? &lt;br&gt;

### How GitHub works (in a nutshell)

__GitHub__ is a platform for hosting and collaborating on __Git__ repositories.

Git is a __version-control system__ that _tracks changes_ made to documents hosted in your local computer, and apply them to the same documents hosted in a _repository_ on GitHub. 

Git also allows you to __pull__ any changes that have been made on the GitHub _remote_ repository to the documents on your local computer.

## The GitHub workflow: A basic example

---
### Step 1: Setting up a repository.

Often, you have some project folder on your local computer that you want to __publish__ as a repository on GitHub.

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/2.png" width="75%" /&gt;


???

Note: A repository can be set up in several ways. You can also _clone_ a repository from GitHub to your local computer. 

repositories, files, directories, commits, pushes, pull requests, commit history, authors, cloning, and checkout. 
From GitHub Docs:
git: an open source, distributed version-control system
GitHub: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories
commit: a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA
branch: a lightweight movable pointer to a commit
clone: a local version of a repository, including all commits and branches
remote: a common repository on GitHub that all team member use to exchange their changes
fork: a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user
pull request: a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews, comments, integrated
tests, and more

---
### Step 1: Setting up a repository.

You can also _clone_ a repository from GitHub to your local computer, which stays linked to the remote repository. _Forking_ a repository copies the repository without staying linked to the remote. 

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/1.png" width="75%" /&gt;



---
### Step 2: Pull the _remote_ repository to your local computer.

Once a repository is set up, you usually want to get to work. __Pulling__ ensures that the documents on your local computer match up with the versions on the _remote_ repository on GitHub.

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/3.png" width="75%" /&gt;

---
### Step 3: Make changes to the files on your local computer.

Now that everything matches up, you can start making some changes in your files. When you save changes to a file, Git tracks the _addition_ and _deletion_ of any characters. 

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/4.png" width="75%" /&gt;

---
### Step 4: __Commit__ your changes.

When you are ready to confirm this new version of your document, you stage and _commit_ your changes. This essentially makes a _snapshot_ of the repository, from which you can flip back and forth.

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/5.png" width="75%" /&gt;

---
### Step 5: __Push__ your committed changes to the _remote_ repository.

You then __push__ the changes that you committed on your local computer to the _remote_ repository. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/6.png" width="75%" /&gt;

???

Note: You can flip back and forth between these _commits_ to work on different versions of your documents. That means you don't have to keep saving files with ever-increasing file names (e.g. Final_draft_May2022_comments_June2022_finaledits.pdf).

## A __collaborative__ GitHub workflow

GitHub becomes even more powerful when you are working collaboratively in a repository. 

When working on a project with a collaborator, they can start a __new branch__ from the main repository. 

Branches are essentially a _working copy_ of the repository, where you can commit changes _without affecting the main repository_. 

--

Branches can be __merged __ into the main repository through a __pull request__, which can be reviewed and approved by the owner of the repository (or other authorized contributors). 

This is very helpful to manage contributions from different collaborators who are working on the same files at the same time!

Let's walk through an example of this workflow.

---
### Step 1: Make a new branch

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/7.png" width="75%" /&gt;

---
### Step 2: Commit changes in the files

&lt;img src="imgs/github_workflow/9.png" width="75%" /&gt;

---
### Step 3: Make a pull request

### Common research workflows in ecology and evolution

.pull-left-35[
Research in ecology and evolution often involves the processing and merging of data from multiple sources.

We commonly modify multiple data files for subsequent analysis.

This process is rarely done just once in a project's lifetime: we add and remove information, and adjust our analysis. 

.onfire[This increases output generation and errors.]

## Errors can be costly.

.pull-left[
.font90[
Humans, even diligent, meticulous and highly trained professionals, make mistakes.

Unsurprisingly, errors increase with lines of code [_e.g._, 15 to 50 errors to 1000 from professional software engineers; McConnell, 2044].

A sign error, a missing semicolon, an off-by-one error in matching columns of data may render the results complete noise (_e.g._, Chang _et al_. 2006, retraction from Science).

Rampant software errors may undermine scientific results (Soergel, 2015), cost money (_CITE_), and even imply in the retraction of scientific publications (e.g., ).

### Mitigating errors: no 'blind trust', and test early, test often

.pull-left[
Long-term recommendations (Joppa et al. 2013, Science):

1. Formal training in statistics, computational methods, mathematics, and software engineering;
2. Scientific publication of software and code, so it can be peer-reviewed.

Practical recommendations:
1. No 'blind trust': verify;
2. Test, test, test, and test early.

???

In 2013, only 30% of researchers using SDMs reported that they used particular software because it had been "validated against other methods in peer-review publications. This rose to 57% for those who used "click-and-run" software with easy-to-manipulate user interfaces and dropped to 11% for those who used "syntax-driven" platforms. Further, 7, 9, and 18% of scientists cited "the developer is well-respected," "personal recommendation," and "recommendation from a close colleague," respectively, as reasons for using software. Only 8% claimed they had validated software against other methods as a primary reason for choice; 79% expressed a desire to learn additional software and programming skills.

### A structured computing workflow can help with reproducibility

A **computing workflow** can help strategically reproducing results every time data or code is modified.

.pull-left[
#### Primary criterion 
1. Reproducibility

.pull-right[
#### Secondary criteria

1. Accurate
2. Efficient
3. Scalable
4. Adaptable
5. Accessible

_Exemplify with GitHub_

Automated data and software management can help reduce the time and effort required by researchers (Yenni _et al_., 2018).

### Adopting automated research workflows in ecology and evolution

**Continuous integration (CI)** is a software development practice in which small adjustments to code are tested every time modifications happen or at user-specified times.

_Include diagram_

CI decreases integration problems [3], ensures
rapid feedback [4], increases software quality [2], and improves developer productivity [5].

# GitHub Actions: Workflows


---

## Workflows are written in __YAML__.

.pull-left[
To make a workflow, you write a __YAML__ file that is stored in your repository, in a directory called `.github/workflows`.

YAML is a human-readable programming language. It is important to remember that _indentation matters_ in YAML!

]

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;An example of a YAML file containing a workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

---

## __Events__ trigger the workflow.

.pull-left[

Workflows run when they are __triggered__ by an event. 

To trigger a workflow, you can:

- __Manually__ start the workflow
- Define triggers `on` __events__ in your repository (e.g. _pushes_ to your `main` repository branch, a _pull request_, a new _issue_, etc.)
- Set a __schedule__ to regularly trigger the workflow.

]
]

---

## The workflow runs __jobs__.

.pull-left[
A workflow is an automated process that runs one or more __jobs__. 

Jobs include one or more _steps_ to achieve some objective (checking code, producing a document, etc.).

You can run a single job, but often you will need to configure your workflow to run several jobs. 

Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.

### Our `deploy-presentation-en` workflow runs __two jobs__.

![](imgs/action_example_jobs.png)

## Jobs are run by __runners__.

.pull-left[
A _runner_ is a server that runs your workflows in a __*fresh* virtual machine__ each time it is triggered. 

Each runner runs one job at a time.

GitHub offers __Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS__ runners. This means you can test your scripts and documents on different systems, to ensure your files work the same for everyone else!

## Each job runs a series of __steps__.

.pull-left[
You usually need to combine several _steps_ to complete a job.

A step can run a _script_ that you write or can run an _action_.

## __GitHub Actions__ perform tasks 

.pull-left-35[

A __GitHub Action__ is an application that performs a task. 

This task is usually something that is __repeated__ often, such as setting up an environment to build your documents, installing R, and building documents like presentations or websites.

Actions help to _simplify_ your workflow.

## __GitHub Actions__: checkout

.pull-left[For example, the first step in our workflow is to __checkout the repository__. To do this, we `use` the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

This action takes care of checking out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so that your workflow can access it to do the next tasks.

## __GitHub Actions__: Set up R

We then need to __set up__ R on our Ubuntu runner (remember - it's fresh! new!). To do this, we `use` the [setup-r](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/setup-r) action. 

See [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) for more Actions for R.

## __GitHub Actions__: you can use R!

.pull-left[

GitHub Actions are particularly useful for _complex_ steps in your job.

For simpler tasks, you can run __R code__ directly in your workflow using this syntax:


```r
Rscript -e 'code here'
```
